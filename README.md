[![Build Badge](https://travis-ci.org/AnthonyWhitakerJr/InventorySifter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AnthonyWhitakerJr/InventorySifter) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AnthonyWhitakerJr/InventorySifter/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/AnthonyWhitakerJr/InventorySifter)

Aids in the complex process of sifting high volumes of inventory.

This program is written with an emphasis on functional design. Each method uses explicit parameters and complete documentation to provide transparency on its effects.

Test data is generated by leveraging a wide variety of over 150 product names and categories<sup>1</sup> combined with unique, auto-generated product numbers and random<sup>2</sup> expiration dates, allowing for diverse and varied testing opportunities. This data can be saved to disk, enabling consistent test execution.

Project also features extensive [unit test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/AnthonyWhitakerJr/InventorySifter).

1. Product names and categories borrowed from [comparegroceryprices.org](http://www.comparegroceryprices.org/search/complete-grocery-list-by-category.shtml).

2. Expiration dates are generated by choosing a random date within a provided range (i.e. between now & 2 months from now). Useful for testing future logic surrounding product expiry.
